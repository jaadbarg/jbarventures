. In short, a well-optimized website makes a small business more discoverable and credible, directly impacting revenue.
2. Mobile Apps
Customer Engagement & Loyalty: Consumers spend the vast majority of their mobile time in apps (about 90% of mobile usage is in apps vs. 10% on the web)​
APPMYSITE.COM
. For small businesses, having a mobile app can dramatically boost engagement – users view 4× more products per session in apps compared to mobile websites and tend to spend longer per visit​
APPMYSITE.COM
. Importantly, apps drive loyalty: roughly 40% of customers report buying more of a brand’s products after downloading its app, and 46% visit the company’s physical store more often​
APPMYSITE.COM
. Features like push notifications, in-app loyalty rewards, and saved preferences keep customers coming back, which translates to higher lifetime value.
Customer Preference for Apps: A significant share of consumers now prefer mobile apps over websites when interacting with businesses. Surveys show 85% of shoppers favor using a mobile app over a mobile website for online shopping due to convenience and speed​
APPMYSITE.COM
. In fact, one 2022 study found 31% of U.S. consumers prefer shopping via a brand’s app even over in-store or desktop options​
NEWSTORE.COM
. The top reason cited is a better user experience – 60% of consumers say they choose apps over mobile sites because apps are more user-friendly and offer a more seamless experience​
NEWSTORE.COM
. For local businesses (restaurants, retailers, etc.), this means an app can become customers’ preferred way to order and interact. For example, 68% of people who order food delivery prefer to order directly from the restaurant’s app/website rather than third-party services​
OWNER.COM
, indicating demand for dedicated mobile ordering platforms.
Higher Conversion & Sales: Well-designed mobile apps tend to convert users into buyers at a much higher rate than mobile websites. On average, mobile apps have a conversion rate ~3× higher than mobile web pages​
APPMYSITE.COM
. (In certain industries like retail, apps see conversion rates 94% higher than mobile web​
TWINR.DEV
.) Faster load times, saved payment info, and smoother checkout all reduce friction. Additionally, app users often have larger basket sizes – one analysis found people view more products and ultimately spend more per session in apps versus on mobile sites​
APPMYSITE.COM
. All of this leads to greater sales growth for small businesses that invest in an app.
Growth of Mobile Commerce: The rise of mobile shopping is a major trend impacting businesses of all sizes. In 2023, mobile commerce (m-commerce) accounted for ~60% of global e-commerce sales​
SELLERSCOMMERCE.COM
 – a huge share that has been climbing yearly. Globally, consumers spent about $2.2 trillion via mobile shopping in 2023​
STATISTA.COM
. In the U.S., nearly 43% of all e-commerce retail sales in 2023 were made on mobile devices​
STATISTA.COM
. This shift means that if your online storefront (whether a web shop or in-app store) isn’t mobile-optimized, you’re potentially excluding over half of your market. For local service providers and restaurants, the implication is clear: customers increasingly expect to handle everything from discovery to booking or ordering on their phones. Embracing a mobile app strategy helps meet customers where they are and capitalize on the continued growth of mobile commerce.
3. E-Commerce Setups
Revenue Uplift from E-Commerce: Adopting e-commerce can significantly boost a small business’s revenue. During the pandemic, many small businesses shifted to online sales – and saw major gains. In a 2024 survey, 72% of small business owners said expanding digital sales channels (online stores, social selling, etc.) increased their sales by at least 20% during the pandemic, and 1 in 10 said their sales doubled​
SMALLBUSINESSMAJORITY.ORG
​
SMALLBUSINESSMAJORITY.ORG
. Even post-pandemic, this digital momentum continues. Small firms that embrace e-commerce are outperforming their peers; for example, at least 60% of U.S. SMBs in 2022 said that e-commerce and digital services were a top priority for their business growth​
MAILMODO.COM
. Simply put, selling online opens your doors to a wider customer base and often leads to higher overall revenue.
Consumer Shift to Online Purchasing: Shoppers have increasingly favored digital channels for convenience and safety, a trend accelerated in the last 2–3 years. Almost 80% of people now shop online at least once a month, and nearly half do so weekly​
STATRYS.COM
. The habit of online buying – whether for products or food orders – is here to stay. For instance, 43% of diners order takeout or delivery at least once a week​
TOUCHBISTRO.COM
. Correspondingly, online ordering in the restaurant sector has exploded: industry reports projected U.S. online ordering and delivery sales to reach $86 billion in 2023, up sharply from ~$60 billion in 2022​
UPMENU.COM
. Many consumers simply prefer the ease of digital ordering. One survey found 64% of consumers say they are more likely to order food for takeout if a restaurant offers online ordering options (vs. phone or walk-in)​
UPMENU.COM
​
UPMENU.COM
. Small restaurants and local retailers that enable online purchases (through e-commerce sites or integrated platforms like Toast, Square, etc.) tap into this demand and can significantly grow sales.
Customer Expectations & Convenience: Today’s customers often expect even small local businesses to offer online shopping or booking. More than 4 in 5 shoppers (81%) do online research before buying anything​
WIX.COM
, and if they can’t easily purchase from you online, they may choose a competitor who does offer that convenience. Surveys indicate 80%+ of consumers mix online and offline channels in their purchase journey​
BRIGHTLOCAL.COM
​
BRIGHTLOCAL.COM
. This includes things like browsing a local shop’s inventory online and then buying in-store, or vice versa. Notably, 50% of mobile “near me” searches lead to an in-store visit within a day (a classic Google statistic), and a meaningful percentage of those searches result in a purchase. The takeaway: having an e-commerce setup (be it a full online store or even just online order forms for services) not only captures pure online sales but also drives in-person business by influencing consumer decisions.
Preference for Digital Ordering: When given a choice, many customers opt to order directly from businesses digitally. For example, 40% of consumers in 2023 said they prefer ordering from a restaurant’s own website or app, compared to only 13% who prefer third-party delivery apps​
TRYCAKE.COM
. This is beneficial for businesses, as direct online orders avoid third-party fees and allow control over the customer experience. It’s no surprise that restaurants have invested heavily in this area – 65% of restaurant operators now use an in-house online ordering system, and 56% partner with delivery apps as well​
UPMENU.COM
. Likewise, local service providers (think salons, home services, etc.) are adding online booking and payment capabilities. Consumers have grown accustomed to the ease of clicking a few buttons to get what they want, and businesses that meet that expectation are winning more customers. Even in Raleigh, NC, and similar markets, local businesses that adopted e-commerce and online ordering early have gained an edge in reaching the tech-savvy customer base.
4. AI Automation
Rising AI Adoption Among Small Businesses: In the last couple of years, AI technology has become much more accessible, and small businesses are rapidly jumping on board. Nearly 4 in 5 small businesses have AI on their radar or have already implemented some form of it​
CIODIVE.COM
. According to a 2024 JPMorgan Chase survey of 2,600 small business leaders, about 50% plan to increase their investment in AI tools in the next year​
CIODIVE.COM
. This is a big jump from 2023, when roughly 40% of small business owners said they had not used any AI – by 2024, the number of small firms using AI had essentially doubled​
CIODIVE.COM
. Whether it’s AI chatbots, automated email marketing, or predictive analytics, small companies are embracing these tools to work smarter.
Efficiency and Profit Gains: Small businesses report that AI and automation are boosting their efficiency and even their bottom line. 87% of small businesses say that adopting technology (like cloud software and AI automation) has increased their business’s efficiency​
USCHAMBER.COM
. In particular, roughly 1 in 4 small businesses now use some form of AI, and these AI-adopting firms saw a notable lift in performance – they were 12 percentage points more likely to report profit growth compared to similar businesses not using AI​
USCHAMBER.COM
. Automation can handle routine tasks faster (and often more accurately) than a person, freeing up staff for higher-value work. For example, AI can automatically sort and respond to basic customer inquiries, schedule appointments, manage inventory alerts, etc., which reduces labor hours. This translates to cost savings and higher capacity: a McKinsey study found companies integrating AI in operations achieved an average 35% reduction in customer service costs and a 32% increase in annual revenue due to improved productivity and service quality​
PLIVO.COM
.
Improved Customer Service (Speed & Experience): One of the most popular uses of AI for small businesses is in customer service – think AI chatbots on websites or Facebook Messenger. These automated agents significantly cut response times, providing instant answers 24/7. Chatbots can respond to customer inquiries 3× faster than human agents on average​
INTERCOM.COM
, and companies using AI bots have seen a 37% drop in first-response time to customers​
PLIVO.COM
. Faster responses lead to happier customers: nearly 70% of consumers say getting quick answers from a chatbot is a big plus and would use bots for simple issues​
DASHLY.IO
. Moreover, AI chatbots can handle up to 80% of routine questions and tasks autonomously​
PLIVO.COM
 – for example, checking order status, booking appointments, or answering FAQ – which lightens the workload on staff. This means small businesses can offer prompt service without needing a large support team. In fact, during peak periods companies have reduced live customer service staffing needs by as much as 68% using chatbots​
PLIVO.COM
. The result is not only faster service but also extended service hours and consistency. It’s telling that about 75% of business owners in 2023 said AI chatbots have improved their overall customer experience by providing instant, round-the-clock assistance​
PLIVO.COM
.
Trends & Competitive Edge: The trends suggest that AI is becoming a standard tool in the small business toolkit. By 2025, an estimated 42% of contact centers (customer support hubs) plan to use AI in some capacity​
PLIVO.COM
, and many marketing and sales tasks are being automated by AI as well. Even for very small local businesses, affordable AI-driven services (for instance, an automated scheduling assistant or an AI-driven email marketing platform) can provide a competitive edge. They allow businesses to appear “bigger” than they are and deliver professional, speedy service. Importantly, adopting AI doesn’t just cut costs – it can drive growth. A KPMG report found that on average, businesses see a $3.5 return for every $1 invested in AI, with some seeing as high as an $8 return​
PLIVO.COM
. Small businesses in tech-forward communities (like Raleigh’s growing tech scene) are increasingly leveraging AI to streamline operations. Those who automate processes and harness data smartly are often able to scale faster and serve customers better, which ultimately boosts revenue. As two-thirds of small business leaders predict higher sales ahead​
CIODIVE.COM
, many are betting that AI-powered efficiency will be a key contributor to that growth.
